--Hello to all PES 2021 enthusiasts! As you know, Sider is a tool widely used by modders to enhance the game's resources, including kits. One of the most popular modules is Kserv. However, many of you may wonder why Kserv isn’t being activated even after following YouTube tutorials. Here’s how you can fix that:

Open sider.ini and enable the kitrewrite.lua module.
Then, add the line lua.module = "kserv.lua" to your sider.ini.
If you've done this and still don't see any changes, please check the Map file, as it might be incorrectly configured.

--Best regards! (Note: This is just a method to activate the Kserv module!)
